Kaptur is a logo recognition tool that can identify what logos are present in an image. A live demo of this will be available soon at https://kapturtech.com/.

I used a similar approach to designing my convolutional neural network that Matthew Earl did for his license plate recognition project. His approach is detailed [here](https://matthewearl.github.io/2016/05/06/cnn-anpr/). 

I used a flickr data set to train the CNN on 27 different types of logos. 

For now the only logos that Kaptur can identify are the following: Adidas, Apple, BMW, Citroen, Coca Cola, DHL, Fedex, Ferrari, Ford, Google, Heineken, HP, McDonalds, Mini, Nbc, Nike, Pepsi, Porsche, Puma, Red Bull, Sprite, Starbucks, Intel, Texaco, Unisef, Vodafone and Yahoo.

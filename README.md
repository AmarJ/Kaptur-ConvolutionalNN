Kaptur is a logo recognition tool that can identify what logos are present in an image. A live demo of this will be available soon at https://kapturtech.com/.

##

Kaptur uses machine learning for the task of detecting logos. I use a similar approach to what Matthew Earl uses for his license plate recognition project when designing my convolutional neural network. His approach can be found [here](https://matthewearl.github.io/2016/05/06/cnn-anpr/). 

I used a Flickr data set to train the CNN on 27 different types of logos. 

For now the only logos that Kaptur can identify are the following: Adidas, Apple, BMW, Citroen, Coca Cola, DHL, Fedex, Ferrari, Ford, Google, Heineken, HP, McDonalds, Mini, Nbc, Nike, Pepsi, Porsche, Puma, Red Bull, Sprite, Starbucks, Intel, Texaco, Unisef, Vodafone and Yahoo.

The approach where I merge Kaptur and Kaptur GraphCut into one really neat tool is in a private repo. Please email me at amarjasarbasic@gmail.com if you would like me to send you the contents of that repo.
